There are several approaches to resolve this issue:

**1. Use Expo's built-in modules:**  If the functionality you need is available through Expo's APIs, use them instead of third-party native modules. For example, instead of `react-native-camera`, consider using `expo-camera`.

**2. Eject from Expo's managed workflow:**  Ejecting allows you to directly work with React Native's native modules and build an app using the bare workflow. This provides full control but removes some of the conveniences that the managed workflow offers. This is a more advanced step.

**3. Choose alternative compatible libraries:** Search for libraries that are specifically designed to work with Expo's managed workflow. Many popular libraries have Expo-compatible versions.

**Example (bugSolution.js):**

```javascript
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera'; // Use expo-camera instead of react-native-camera

// ... rest of your component using expo-camera
```

**Remember to install the necessary Expo modules:**  `expo install expo-camera`

The key is to prioritize Expo's managed workflow capabilities and utilize modules that are compatible with it whenever possible.  Ejecting should be considered a last resort.
